how to define your function?

sqr x = x*x

fact 1 = 1
fact n = fact (n-1) * n

condition operator:

abs x = if x > 0
	then x
	else -x

you can define your own operators:

i @@ j = i*i + j*j

example call:
5 @@ 7

you can use arbitrary sequence of symbols except some reserved:
for example, -> and ::
