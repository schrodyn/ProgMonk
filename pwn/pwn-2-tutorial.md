Some words about myself. Today I know just some basics about pwn (or
binary exploitation). One time I said: "Wow! It's cool! I want to
write my own exploits, shellcodes and packers like a pro!". And then
asked myself with reasonable questions: "How can I learn it? What 
knowledge I should have before going further?"

While researching this theme I found enough resources where this stuff
was explained BUT I didn't understand almost anything. Be precisely 
I've got at HOW to make it but not WHY it works. So I put Pwn 
aside and started learning deeply C, assembly, and basics of system
architectures. Yes, you do really need to have a good grasp in these
themes if you want to be succeed. Don't worry if you haven't it right
now. I've put there all resources that I've learnt so far. So I 
recommend to start here.

##C Language

  * **Beginning C, 4th Edition By Ivor Horton**

  This was my first book in C. The best book I've ever read. Precisely
  clear explanation of all topics necessary for programming in C.

  * **The C Programming Language: 2nd Edition**

  *De facto* the bible of C Programming language. I suppose every true
  programmer should read this book. You can read it [here](http://0x80.cf/books/2015-12-07-c_programming_language.html).

  * **C Traps And Pitfalls**

  Really cool book. Super explanation of pointers to functions and
  other complicated stuff. Must read for everyone who wants to learn
  writing and testing your own shellcode. You can read it [here](http://0x80.cf/books/2015-12-22-c_traps_and_pitfalls.html).

While reading this books I've put some tips and essential info. You can
find it in this repository in **C** folder.

##Assembly

If you are Russian I advise you to start learning assembly [here](http://bitfry.narod.ru/). This is where I started.

Also If you are using Linux (and you should have :)) and you are 
Russian I recommend [this book](https://ru.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/%D0%90%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%80_%D0%B2_Linux_%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2_C) to continue.  

Furthermore I've found [x86 Disassembly wikibook](https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/Print_Version) very useful.

Ok, to summarize today I know only how to write simple buffer overflows
and ROP chains. Also I understand all essential info in this books.
