#Analyzing 3rd Party Shellcode

I don't have a video with this lection but I recommend to watch
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzn0wEyJGDA) and 
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e93dz35PwU8) also by 
Vivek Ramachandran on the same topic.

Also I would really advice you to check Student's Slides on this 
lecture which you can find in this folder.
