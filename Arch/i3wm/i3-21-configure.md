#Commands

Commands are what you bind to specific keypresses. You can also issue commands at runtime
without pressing a key by using the IPC interface. An easy way to do this is to use
the `i3-msg` utility:

Example:

```
# execute this on your shell to make the current container borderless
i3-msg border none
```

Commands can be chained by using `;` (a semicolon). So, to move a window to a specific workspace and immediately switch to that workspace, you can configure the following keybinding:

Example:

```
bindsym $mod+x move container to workspace 3; workspace 3
```

Furthermore, you can change the scope of a command - that is, which containers should be affected
by that command, by using various criteria. The criteria are specified before any command
in a pair of square brackets and are separated by space.

When using multiple commands, separate them by using a `,` (a comma) instead of a semicolon.
Criteria apply only until the next semicolon, so if you use a semicolon to separate commands,
only the first one will be executed for the matched window(s).

Example:

```
# if you want to kill all windows which have the class Firefox, use:
bindsym $mod+x [class="Firefox"] kill

# same thing, but case-insensitive
bindsym $mod+x [class="(?i)firefox"] kill

# kill only the About dialog from Firefox
bindsym $mod+x [class="Firefox" window_role="About"] kill

# enable floating mode and move container to workspace 4
for_window [class="^evil-app$"] floating enable, move container to workspace 4
```

The criteria which are currently implemented are:

  * class

  Compares the window class (the second part of WM_CLASS). Use the special value `focused` to match all windows having the same window class as the currently focused window.

  * instance

  Compares the window instance (the first part of WM_CLASS). Use the special value `focused` to match all windows having the same window instance as the currently focused window.

  * window_role

  Compares the window role (WM_WINDOW_ROLE). Use the special value focused to match all windows having the same window role as the currently focused window.

  * window_type

  Compare the window type (`_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE`). Possible values are `normal`, `dialog`, `utility`,
  `toolbar`, `splash`, `menu`, `dropdown_menu`, `popup_menu` and `tooltip`.

  * id

  Compares the X11 window ID, which you can get via `xwininfo` for example.

  * title

  Compares the X11 window title (`_NET_WM_NAME` or `WM_NAME` as fallback). Use the special value `focused`
  to match all windows having the same window title as the currently focused window.

  * workspace

  Compares the workspace name of the workspace the window belongs to. Use the special value `focused` to
  match all windows in the currently focused workspace.

The criteria `class`, `instance`, `role`, `title`, `workspace` are actually regular expressions (PCRE). See `pcresyntax(3)` or `perldoc perlre` for information on how to use them.

##Sticky floating windows

If you want a window to stick to the glass, i.e., have it stay on screen even if you switch to another workspace, you can use the `sticky` command. For example, this can be useful for notepads,
a media player or a video chat window.

Note that while any window can be made sticky through this command, it will only take effect if the window is floating.

Syntax:

```
sticky enable|disable|toggle
```
Examples:

```
# make a terminal sticky that was started as a notepad
for_window [instance=notepad] sticky enable
```

##Changing (named) workspaces/moving to workspaces

To change to a specific workspace, use the `workspace` command, followed by the number or name of the workspace. To move containers to specific workspaces, use `move container to workspace`.

Syntax:

```
workspace next|prev|next_on_output|prev_on_output
workspace back_and_forth
workspace <name>
workspace number <name>

move [window|container] [to] workspace <name>
move [window|container] [to] workspace number <name>
move [window|container] [to] workspace prev|next|current
```

Examples:

```
bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1
bindsym $mod+2 workspace 2
bindsym $mod+3 workspace 3:<span foreground="red">vim</span>
...

bindsym $mod+Shift+1 move container to workspace 1
bindsym $mod+Shift+2 move container to workspace 2
...

# switch between the current and the previously focused one
bindsym $mod+b workspace back_and_forth
bindsym $mod+Shift+b move container to workspace back_and_forth

# move the whole workspace to the next output
bindsym $mod+x move workspace to output right

# move firefox to current workspace
bindsym $mod+F1 [class="Firefox"] move workspace current
```

##Named workspaces

Workspaces are identified by their name. So, instead of using numbers in the workspace command,
you can use an arbitrary name:

Example:

```
bindsym $mod+1 workspace mail
...
```

If you want the workspace to have a number **and** a name, just prefix the number, like this:

Example:

```
bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1: mail
bindsym $mod+2 workspace 2: www
...
```

Note that the workspace will really be named "1: mail". i3 treats workspace names beginning with
a number in a slightly special way. Normally, named workspaces are ordered the way they appeared.
When they start with a number, i3 will order them numerically. Also, you will be able to use
`workspace number 1` to switch to the workspace which begins with number 1,
regardless of which name it has.

##Renaming workspaces

You can rename workspaces. This might be useful to start with the default numbered workspaces,
do your work, and rename the workspaces afterwards to reflect whatâ€™s actually on them. You can also
omit the old name to rename the currently focused workspace.

Syntax:

```
rename workspace <old_name> to <new_name>
rename workspace to <new_name>
```

Examples:

```
i3-msg 'rename workspace 5 to 6'
i3-msg 'rename workspace 1 to "1: www"'
i3-msg 'rename workspace "1: www" to "10: www"'
i3-msg 'rename workspace to "2: mail"'
bindsym $mod+r exec i3-input -F 'rename workspace to "%s"' -P 'New name: '
```
