##Split focused window

By default, to split a window vertically, press $mod+v before you create the new window. To split it horizontally, press $mod+h.

I've configured it as follows:

```
bindsym $mod+v split h
bindsym $mod+r split v
```

As mnemonic rule, `split h` divides window on **two columns**, so I think it's "`v`ertically",
`split v` divides window on **two rows**, so I've setuped it as `$mod+r` ("row").
