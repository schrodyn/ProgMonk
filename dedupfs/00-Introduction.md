#Introduction

Someone may ask: "**_Why to implement yet another filesystem?_**".

There are a lot of books on Operating Systems that try to learn you 
something. Yes, this is the good word _"try"_, at least for me. 
Every time I'was reading OS books I had one answer: _"Okay, man, 
but how it really works? It seems like something abstract."_

##My story...

I've studied in SPBU university for 3 years and realised that I don't  
really know inner workings of computer. At low level I knew only C 
and some Assembly. So I've decided to go deeper in Linux kernel and 
make something cool :)

I believe in hands-on approach. As you code it -- you understand it.   
Implementing linux filesystem will give me (and you) thorough 
knowledge in kernel development. Also it's fun :)

First of all, I have no previous experience in OS projects. Also I 
didn't find any full step-by-step tutorials on these topic, so I'll 
try to make it. I will post here all my progress and new knowledge 
on this field.

We'll start from general concepts of Linux filesystems and then go 
deeper.

This series is a *"structured mix"* of all I've found and 
contains a lot of excerpts. You may also think it is an easy guide 
to filesystem developing.
