#Introduction

The NCurses library is a programming tool you can use in UNIX 
distributions as well as in Windows under CYGWIN to program, control, and manipulate text
on the terminal screen. With NCurses you can control interactive I/O, organize information 
into windows on the screen, use color to highlight text and
organize information, and even use a mouse to further refine input. 
It's all possible with NCurses.

Most UNIX operating systems today use a graphical user interface (GUI),
though for programming Curses you'll need to have access to a terminal
screen. This can be a terminal window inside the GUI.

#Curses or NCurses?

The Curses library of terminal control functions has been with UNIX since the early 1980s. As such, it was part of the older versions of UNIX, which
required complex licenses and such to be used.

NCurses is the "New Curses" software emulation of the original Curses and is available from the GNU folks at the Free Software Foundation.
